## PagerDuty Setup

There are two methods to generate root logins alerts in PagerDuty.

### Method 1: CloudWatch Rule

Use this method if already have a SNS topic handling existing CW Events.

1. In TF or manually create a PagerDuty CloudWatch [integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/aws-cloudwatch-integration-guide#section-integrating-with-a-pager-duty-service)
1. In TF ensure that the PagerDuty endpoint provided is assigned/subscribed to the SNS topic. For more info see the AWS topic about the proper [policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CWE_Troubleshooting.html#RuleTriggeredMoreThanOnce).
1. Apply this module to the SNS topic.
1. Test by logging in as root



### Method 2: Custom PagerDuty Event

Use this method if wishing to have a dedicated SNS topic for PagerDuty alerts or custom message parsing for advanced PagerDuty features.

1. In TF or manually create a PagerDuty [Custom Event Transformer](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/cet) CloudWatch
1. In TF ensure that the PagerDuty endpoint provided is assigned/subscribed to the SNS topic. For more info see the AWS topic about the proper [policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CWE_Troubleshooting.html#RuleTriggeredMoreThanOnce).
1. Apply this module to the SNS topic with the `send_sns = true` and customizing the [input_template](https://github.com/trussworks/terraform-aws-root-login-notifications/blob/master/main.tf#L46) as needed.
1. Test by logging in as root
